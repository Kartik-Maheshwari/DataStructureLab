// 13. Let us work on the menu of a library. Create a structure containing book information like accession number, name of author, book title and flag to know whether book is issued or not. Create a menu in which the following can be done.
//  1 - Display book information
//  2 - Add a new book
//  3 - Display all the books in the library of a particular author
//  4 - Display the number of books of a particular title
//  5 - Display the total number of books in the library
//  6 - Issue a book
//  (If we issue a book, then its number gets decreased by 1 and if we add a book, its number gets increased by 1)
