The circular linked list can be of two types:
1-> Singly circular linked list     2-> Doubly circular linked list
If the last node of the singly linked list contains the address of the first node then it is circular singly 
linked list:

        100            200          300           400
      |10|200|  ->  |20|300|  ->  |30|400|  ->  |40|100|  
        |                                           |
        |-------------------------------------------|

the address of last node is given with the help of this node we can move to first node
