This is also called two way linked list. In this list each Node contains three fields
       prev            next
    |       |       |       |
               val
Each node contains the address of their neighbours(both sides).The first Node's prev is NULL 
whereas the last node's next has NULL.

    | \o | 10 |   |   <--->   | | 20 | |   <--->  | | 30 | |    <--->  |   | 40 | \o |
         start

We can move forward and backward easily by add of next and prev. It takes more memory than linked list.
